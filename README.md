Hello, Data World!

## 🤓 Who Am I?
Just your friendly neighborhood data scientist in the making! I'm currently majoring in Data Science at Polytech Marseille, where I'm learning to speak fluent Python and SQL with a French accent.

## 🚀 My Cosmic Data Journey
- 🛰️ Interned at Bouygues Telecom (where I learned that "Big Data" isn't just about oversized dates)
- 🥘 Studied abroad at Universidad Politécnica de Valencia (because who doesn't want to analyze data while eating paella?)

## 💼 What's in My Data Toolbox?
- 🐍 Python (my digital pet snake)
- 📊 Data Visualization (making charts prettier than my Instagram feed)
- 🤖 Machine Learning (teaching computers to be smarter than me)
- 🗄️ SQL (because someone needs to talk to the databases)

## 🎯 Current Mission
I'm currently doing my internship at Bouygues Telecom and in the same time i'm looking for a new opportunity this time as a full time data scientist ot ml engineer.

## 📫 How to Reach Me
Smoke signals, carrier pigeons, or just drop me an email at saadyaqine91@gmail.com or connect with me in [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saad-yaqine-9461b2216/). I promise I'll respond faster than my neural networks converge!

Remember: In data we trust, but first, we clean it!
